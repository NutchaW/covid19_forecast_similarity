All component models that provide forecasts at all required quantile levels for all forecasts at 1 to 4 week ahead horizons (or 1 to 28 day ahead for hospitalizations) are included. From 2021-02-10 to 2021-03-01, ensemble forecasts at each quantile level are a weighted linear combination of the component model forecasts at that quantile level. Weights are estimated separately for each combination of geographic scale (county, state, or national) and prediction target variable (inc case, inc hosp, inc death, cum death). Model weights are estimated by optimizing the mean weighted interval score (WIS) of the ensemble forecasts in past weeks, subject to the constraints that the weights are non-negative and sum to 1, and the predictive quantiles are properly ordered. We select an ensemble specification with best mean WIS across all past weeks in a retrospective evaluation; a separate specification may be selected for each combination of geographic scale and prediction target variable. We consider variations on training that use a single shared weight across all quantile levels for each model, separate weights for each quantile level, or three groups of quantile levels (the four in the lower tail, the 15 in the middle, and the 4 in the upper tail). We also consider varying ranges for how many past weeks of forecasts are used in weight estimation, from 3 weeks to 10 weeks (except at county level, where we only consider window sizes of 3 weeks). For the national and state level, we also consider estimation jointly across those geographic units. During the weight estimation process, any missing forecasts are mean-imputed; the estimated weights are then redistributed to account for missingness patterns (so that models with missing forecasts in the training window will have their estimated weight discounted). From 2021-05-03 to 2021-05-17, ensemble forecasts are an equally weighted median of the forecasts from the top-performing individual forecasters.  Top performing forecasters are selected based on the relative WIS, which measures the average performance of each model relative to all other models on the subset of forecasts that each pair of models has in common (see https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.03.21250974v1 for more detail).

The econometric model relates the change in log active (new) infections between now and some future horizon to the current transmission rate and the susceptible share of the population. The current transmission rate is assumed to be a function of individuals’ mobility behavior and weather (temperature and precipitation). County level mobility is measured using the Mobility and Engagement Index (MEI) constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas from mobile device geolocation data provided by Safegraph. County level weather data comes from weather station readings on daily-high temperatures and precipitation from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), following the methodology in Wilson (2019). For diseases that convey long-lasting immunity to those who have recovered from infection, the susceptible share is simply one minus the share of the local population that have previously been infected. We assume this share in a given county is proportional to cumulative confirmed cases to date as a share of the county’s population. This proportionality also implies that the change in log active infections can be proxied by the change in log active cases. Aside from mobility, weather, and accumulated natural immunity, there are two other important elements of the econometric model. The first is lagged infection growth, allowing for the possibility that lagged infection growth is predictive of subsequent infection growth. The second additional element is county-specific intercepts (fixed effects), which allow each county to have a different mean level of infection growth, independent of the other elements of the model.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE

Stay-at-home orders and  subsequent social distancing interventions are updated at the state-level according to recent policy documents. Vaccination rates and reductions to the hospitalization and mortality rates are state-specific by week. Ongoing NPIs continued through the remainder  of the simulation period, while vaccination coverage continues to increase slowly in subsequent months until it reaches a maximum 90% coverage per group. Intervention effects are inferred where  possible.
To model deaths and hospitalizations in the population, we incorporated  realistic but fixed time delays from infection to symptom onset to hospitalization to  ICU to ventilator use to death and used age-specific demographics to perform  a county-level age standardization of health outcome risk. Currently, we  assume a 0.5% infection fatality rate and a 3.5:1 ratio of incident hospitalizations to deaths. The model assumes that vaccinated individuals have both reductions in susceptibility and reductions in hospitalization and mortality.

The model consists of two processes. The first process  is a statistical model of how the  number of COVID-19 infections changes over time. The second process maps the number of  infections to the reported data. We model the growth of new cases as the product of a  dynamic growth parameter and the underlying numbers of susceptible and infected cases  in the population at the previous time step, scaled by the size of the state's starting  susceptible population.

The final forecasts are an ensemble of three models, two fit with LightGBM (gradient boosted trees) and a third with Keras (neural net). The models are based on a few of the top models in the Kaggle competitions from last spring. a. The first LightGBM model builds many time-series features from the raw training data. b. The second LightGBM model incorporates some external data, including basic forecasts from SAS Visual Studio and Facebook Prophet, plus some more exotic ones like genomic clade proportions in each location. c. The neural net model is the simplest in terms of features, primarily relying on 28 daily lagged values, but is able to train on case and fatality data all at once. 2. The LightGBM models are trained separately on cases and fatalities using quantile loss for each of the seven quantiles [0.025, 0.100, 0.250, 0.500, 0.750, 0.900, 0.975] on daily data from all major countries worldwide (also from JHU) and all US counties. The neural net is trained using pinball loss over all of these same seven quantiles but separately for each of 28 days into the future. Cubic spline interpolation is used for the death targets to produce forecasts for an additional 16 quantiles. 3. Ensemble weights are chosen by hand each week based on performance in the previous week. The most common weighting scheme is equal, with 1/3 on each model.  Other weightings are simple fractions like 0.4, 0.4, 0.2.

We modified the model parameters to represent the natural history of COVID-19 and calibrated a set of parameters to reproduce current trends of deaths due to COVID-19 in the US. FRED simulates the spread of the virus in a population by recreating interactions among people on a daily basis. To accurately represent the population of each of the states simulated, we used a synthetic population of the US that represents demographic and geographic characteristics of the population in 2010 (Wheaton 2012). Each human is modeled as an agent that visits a set of places defined by their activity space. This activity space contains places such as households, schools, workplaces, or neighborhood locations. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur when an infected person visits the same location as a susceptible person on the same day. Numbers of contacts per person are specific to each place type. For instance, school contacts do not depend on the size of the school but the age of the agent. Infected agents have a probability to stay at home if they develop symptoms. Those who do not stay at home continue their daily activities. Public health interventions are included in the model to represent the changes in agents’ behavior in response to an epidemic.  In this study, we limited the interventions to school closure and shelter in place. Schools are closed on a specific date to represent state-level guidelines (IHME COVID-19 health service utilization forecasting Team and Murray 2020). In the case that schools are closed, students limit their activity space to household or neighborhood locations. Shelter-in-place interventions reduce each agent’s activity space to their household at a compliance level from 0-100%, which was estimated as part of the model calibration. Agents who do not comply with the shelter-in-place orders continue with their daily routines. We used state-level orders to determine the date at which people are advised to shelter in place (IHME COVID-19 health service utilization forecasting Team and Murray 2020).  See the methods file in our repo for more detailed methods and model limitations.
Updates 2020-05-11 - We updated our likelihood used in our calibration, switching from a Poisson to a negative binomial distribution in order to allow for greater over-dispersion in the distribution of deaths. - We changed the way that we calculate the proportion of the population that is sheltering in place. We no longer use the dates at which government advisories were issued. Instead, we now exclusively use the google mobility data (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) on journeys made to residential locations.

Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur when an infected person visits the same location as a susceptible person on the same day. Numbers of contacts per person are specific to each place type. For instance, school contacts do not depend on the size of the school but the age of the agent. Infected agents have a probability to stay at home if they develop symptoms. Those who do not stay at home continue their daily activities. Public health interventions are included in the model to represent the changes in agents’ behavior in response to an epidemic.  In this study, we limited the interventions to school closure and shelter in place. Schools are closed on a specific date to represent state-level guidelines (IHME COVID-19 health service utilization forecasting Team and Murray 2020). In the case that schools are closed, students limit their activity space to household or neighborhood locations. Shelter-in-place interventions reduce each agent’s activity space to their household at a compliance level from 0-100%, which was estimated as part of the model calibration. Agents who do not comply with the shelter-in-place orders continue with their daily routines. We used state-level orders to determine the date at which people are advised to shelter in place (IHME COVID-19 health service utilization forecasting Team and Murray 2020).  See the methods file in our repo for more detailed methods and model limitations.
Updates 2020-05-11 - We updated our likelihood used in our calibration, switching from a Poisson to a negative binomial distribution in order to allow for greater over-dispersion in the distribution of deaths. - We changed the way that we calculate the proportion of the population that is sheltering in place. We no longer use the dates at which government advisories were issued. Instead, we now exclusively use the google mobility data (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) on journeys made to residential locations. We calibrate the maximum compliance to shelter in place, and use a generalized additive model fitted to the google data to forecast movement in the coming 5 weeks.

Each model compartment is sub-divided into nine different age categories.  To model the state of Illinois, we divide the state into four regions based on the Restore Illinois plan. We infer a common statewide pre-intervention transmission rate, and a separate post-intervention transmission rate for each of the four regions. We also infer a region-specific initial number of infected individuals. Other model parameters are informed by Illinois-specific data or best estimates from existing literature. We fit the model to incident in-hospital deaths and confirmed COVID-19 ICU cases prior to May 15, 2020.

Changed date of post-SIP transmission rise from May 29, 2020 to June 1, 2020. Added datastream to fit: non-hospitalized deaths through 2020-04-26. Incorporated uncertainty in the fraction of total deaths that are non-hospitalized. Fitted to hospitalized death and ICU data through 2020-05-15. Model submitted for ensemble assumes an increase in transmission 10% of the way back to pre-SIP transmission centered on June 1. 
2020-05-11: Changed date of transmission increase from May 15 to May 29; added non-hospitalized deaths to process model instead of calculating post-hoc; switched from statewide to region-specific, symmetric contact matrices; fitted with data through May 8, 2020. Model submitted for ensemble assumes baseline scenario, i.e., no change in transmission.

Information from subject matter experts (SMEs) is  used to develop a prior probability distribution over the model parameters.  This  then combined with a statistical model of the model-data mismatch to produce a posterior  probability distribution over the model parameters that incorporates both the cumulative  observations and subject matter expertise.  The parameters that maximize the posterior  probability density are used to make forecasts into the future.  The effective reproduction  number is computed using the next-generation matrix method.
Deaths are estimated from this model through a procedure which leverages state-level  data on recoveries and fatalities.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE
