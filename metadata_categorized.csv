Weights are estimated separately for each combination of geographic scale (county, state, or national) and prediction target variable (inc case, inc hosp, inc death, cum death). Model weights are estimated by optimizing the mean weighted interval score (WIS) of the ensemble forecasts in past weeks, subject to the constraints that the weights are non-negative and sum to 1, and the predictive quantiles are properly ordered. We select an ensemble specification with best mean WIS across all past weeks in a retrospective evaluation; a separate specification may be selected for each combination of geographic scale and prediction target variable. We consider variations on training that use a single shared weight across all quantile levels for each model, separate weights for each quantile level, or three groups of quantile levels (the four in the lower tail, the 15 in the middle, and the 4 in the upper tail). We also consider varying ranges for how many past weeks of forecasts are used in weight estimation, from 3 weeks to 10 weeks (except at county level, where we only consider window sizes of 3 weeks). For the national and state level, we also consider estimation jointly across those geographic units.

Without any social-\distancing policy or geological/demographic inputs, the model works very well \for the twenty hardest-hit counties in the United States. This model is quite \different from other models yet provide parameters with clear physical meaning. \We have shown the cumulative mobility plays the role of time in controling \exponential growth of outbreak. Furthermore, there exists a critical relative \mobility above which outbreak will occur. For NYC, this critical relative \mobility is 30%. The critical relative mobility is ~60% for all other counties. \In this forecast, we chose the ~30 heaviest hit states, while combine the rest \of the states together into one superstate. This practice is necessary to obtain \meaningful model parameters. The forecast is based on Eq. 3 of the citation above, \fatality-reference, which is the average of the 11-day-period prior to prediction-date. \The cumulative mobility is the average of three Google mobility categories: \retail and recreation, transit station and work place. We have shown in \our paper those three categorites behave similarly. We conducted standard error \analysis on our forecast in which the uncertainty comes from both the fitting \error and the variation of the reference fatality. Quantile forecast is calculated \based on standard error assuming normal distribution. State-level forecast has been \included for 32 states.

Additionally, the UnIT score emerges as the most important factor explaining observed county-specific incidence trends for COVID-19 in the US, with coefficients in multi-variate regression far outweighing those for typical co-variates. Thus, our key insight is that past incidence patterns for a different pathogen can substantially inform current projections, provided the transmission mechanisms are broadly similar.
